                    I am a backend developer based in Montana! I live with my fiance Coco and our dog Buckaroo.
                    I love to build things, read, and workout. I currently work for Brightvine, a company that is
                    building auditing software for financial securities using blockchain and AI technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My stack is currently golang, SQL - postgres, and typescript. I work on buildng backend-apis
                    using GraphQL and RESTful endpoints. In 2024 I implemented a resource sharing
                    system, migrated our blockchain wrapper from nodejs to golang, integrated a third party
                    pricing service, and created a docker container for live debugging of our local application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2022 I architected the companies smart contracts in solidiity, built the nodejs
                    wrapper for the blockchain that used event based communication (GCP pub/sub), worked on our
                    local wallet solution that allowed our users to interact with the blockchain without ever
                    having to register or deal with a crypto wallet. I also helped maintain our hyperledger besu
                    (blockchain) implementation deployed on Azure.
                </p>

                    Before Brightvine I recieved my Masters Degree in Computer Science from Montana State University.
                    I did research using an Integer Linear Program to find the optimal credit and tax incentives for
                    carbon capture and storage pipelines in California and Kansas. You can read my <a

                    here. I worked under <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/yaw/">Sean Yaw</a>. Besides my thesis I
                    worked as a tutor for Data Structures and Alorithms as well as a teaching assistant for Computer
                    Systems.

                <p>
                    In even older news I graduated from <a href="https://info.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a> in 2019.
                    Worked as a Data Entry Specialist and then as a Data Analyst for United Road Services. Recieved my
                    undergraduate Degree in Economics at Purdue University. Growing up I played competivie ice hockey in
                    Austin and Dallas Texas as well as in Los Angeles, CA. I love to read books and I can still solve a
                    rubix cube.
